perlnow.el is a collection of utility commands for perl
programmers who use emacs. These commands are designed to help
automate some routine tasks in the initial creation of perl
scripts and modules. Commands are also provided to assist in
running, testing and debugging inside of emacs.

Detailed documentation has been included inside the *.el file
itself, using the "docstrings" that are easily accessible through
the emacs help system (e.g by asking for help on a "variable"
named "perlnow-documentation-tutorial"). Think of it as the poor
man's pod (or perhaps the lazy man's info).

INSTALLATION

Put the perlnow.el file somewhere that's included in your load-path.

Also install template.el if at all possible, because many
features of this package depend on template.el.  The latest
version can be found at:

   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=47369

You'll need some custom perl-oriented template.el templates ("*.tpl")
that come with perlnow.el.  Most likely these templates should go in
~/.templates.

Add something like the following to your ~/.emacs file:

   (require 'template)
   (template-initialize)
   (require 'perlnow)

  (setq perlnow-script-location
      (substitute-in-file-name "$HOME/bin"))
  (setq perlnow-pm-location
      (substitute-in-file-name "$HOME/lib"))
  (setq perlnow-dev-location
      (substitute-in-file-name "$HOME/dev"))

   (perlnow-define-standard-keymappings)

Alternately, if you'd like a different prefix than the
default "C-c\", you can supply it as an argument:

   (perlnow-define-standard-keymappings "C-c'")
